# TermColors
Tiny header file to provide Linux terminal color output.


Defines some color codes, An array that can be iterated through
and some simple prebuilt print statements. 

Looking through the header ~75 lines should provide more then enough
information.

TODO:
  Should build object (.so)? if we want to keep the functions,
  then include and link.

Modify to your own needs.
